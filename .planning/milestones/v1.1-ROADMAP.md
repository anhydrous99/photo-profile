# Milestone v1.1: Enhancement

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 11-14
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Enrich the viewing experience with EXIF metadata, polished lightbox interactions, better album management, and shareability.

## Phases

### Phase 11: EXIF Metadata Pipeline

**Goal**: Visitors see camera and shooting details for every photo without the admin doing any manual data entry
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Requirements**: EXIF-01, EXIF-02, EXIF-03, EXIF-04
**Plans:** 3 plans
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Uploading a new photo automatically extracts and stores camera, lens, focal length, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and date taken
2. GPS coordinates and camera serial numbers are never stored or displayed, even when present in the original file
3. Opening a photo in the lightbox shows its EXIF metadata (camera, lens, settings) in a non-intrusive display
4. Running the backfill process populates EXIF data for all previously uploaded photos that have originals on disk

Plans:

- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Backend: ExifData type, extraction service, schema migration, worker integration
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: EXIF panel in lightbox with toolbar toggle, data flow through pages
- [x] 11-03-PLAN.md — Backfill: CLI script to populate EXIF for existing photos

### Phase 12: Lightbox Polish

**Goal**: The lightbox feels native and responsive across devices -- right image size, fluid gestures, immersive viewing
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (EXIF data displayed in lightbox)
**Requirements**: LBOX-01, LBOX-02, LBOX-03, LBOX-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Lightbox loads the image derivative closest to the viewer's screen width instead of always loading the largest size
2. On mobile, swiping down on a photo closes the lightbox
3. On mobile, pinch-to-zoom and double-tap-to-zoom magnify the current photo
4. A fullscreen button appears in the lightbox toolbar and entering fullscreen hides browser chrome (gracefully absent on unsupported browsers like iPhone Safari)

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Backend: Add width/height to Photo entity, schema, worker, and data pipeline
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: Enable Zoom, Fullscreen, srcSet, gestures in lightbox + dimensions backfill script
- [x] 12-03-PLAN.md — Verification: Human testing of all lightbox polish features

### Phase 13: Album Management

**Goal**: The admin has full control over how an album presents itself -- which photo represents it and what order photos appear in
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phases 11-12; can run in parallel with Phase 12)
**Requirements**: ALBM-01, ALBM-02, ALBM-03, ALBM-04
**Infrastructure fixes included**:

- Fix `coverPhotoId` FK constraint (schema says SET NULL, DB has NO ACTION)
- Fix `findByAlbumId()` to ORDER BY `photo_albums.sortOrder`

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Admin can click a photo in the album detail view to set it as the album's cover, and the album listing page shows that cover photo
2. The current cover photo is visually distinguished from other photos in the admin album detail view
3. Admin can drag photos into a custom order within the album detail view and the new order persists after page reload
4. The public album page displays photos in the same order the admin arranged them
5. Deleting a photo that is an album's cover sets the cover to null instead of failing or leaving a dangling reference

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Backend: Fix FK constraint, ORDER BY, addToAlbum sortOrder + photo reorder API
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: Admin album detail page with drag-to-reorder grid and cover photo selection

### Phase 14: Shareability

**Goal**: Visitors can link directly to a specific photo and shared links look good when previewed on social media
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (EXIF data enriches OG tags), Phase 13 (album covers used in OG images, photo ordering for navigation context)
**Requirements**: SHAR-01, SHAR-02, SHAR-03, SHAR-04
**Plans:** 3 plans
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Opening a photo in the lightbox updates the browser URL to include that photo's identifier without adding excessive history entries
2. Navigating to a URL with a photo identifier opens the page with the lightbox already showing that specific photo
3. Sharing an album URL on social media shows a preview card with the album's title, description, and cover photo image
4. Sharing the homepage URL on social media shows a preview card with the site name and description

Plans:

- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — URL sync in lightbox + slug-based photo lookup infrastructure
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Deep link pages + OpenGraph meta tags for all public routes
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Human verification of shareability features

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- EXIF stored as JSON TEXT column (flexible for future field additions)
- exif-reader for EXIF parsing (Sharp maintainer recommended, TypeScript types)
- Privacy fields never accessed at extraction level (GPS, serial numbers)
- sharp().rotate().metadata() for post-rotation dimensions
- Width/height nullable for graceful fallback on legacy photos
- 8-char UUID prefix as photo slug (negligible collision for personal portfolio)
- replaceState for URL sync (no history entries, no React re-renders)
- useState initializer for deep link landing (avoids flash)
- WebP 1200w for OG images (AVIF unsupported by social media crawlers)
- React cache() for generateMetadata (deduplicates DB queries)
- rectSortingStrategy for dnd-kit grid layout
- DragOverlay with presentational clone for drag feedback
- SQLite table recreation for FK constraint fix (ALTER CONSTRAINT not supported)
- PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON for FK enforcement

**Issues Resolved:**

- coverPhotoId FK constraint mismatch (schema SET NULL, DB NO ACTION) — fixed in Phase 13
- findByAlbumId() not ordering by sortOrder — fixed in Phase 13
- ExifPanel z-index below YARL portal — fixed to z-[10000]

**Issues Deferred:**

- Docker not installed on dev machine — Redis/Docker builds untested
- Stale comment in imageProcessor.ts (says JPEG, generates AVIF)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None significant
