  <what-built>
Complete homepage with hero + grid layout, random photo selection, and lightbox integration.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Prerequisites:** Development server running (`npm run dev`), at least one published album with ready photos.

1. **Visit homepage:** Go to http://localhost:3000

2. **Check layout:**
   - Header shows logo/initials on left, "Albums" link on right
   - One large hero photo at top
   - Grid of smaller photos below (2 columns mobile, 3 columns desktop)
   - White background, spacious whitespace
   - No borders, shadows, or hover effects on photos

3. **Test random selection:**
   - Refresh the page 3-4 times
   - Photos should change (different selection each time)

4. **Test lightbox:**
   - Click the hero photo - lightbox opens
   - Use arrow keys or buttons to navigate
   - Verify navigation stays within homepage photos (should cycle through 7-9 photos only)
   - Press Escape or X to close

5. **Test navigation:**
   - Click "Albums" in header
   - Should navigate to /albums page

6. **Test responsive:**
   - Resize browser to mobile width
   - Grid should become 2 columns
   - Hero should still display prominently

7. **Test empty state (optional):**
   - If you can temporarily unpublish all albums, homepage should show "No photos available yet."
     </how-to-verify>
     <resume-signal>Type "approved" if homepage looks and functions correctly, or describe any issues.</resume-signal>
     </task>
