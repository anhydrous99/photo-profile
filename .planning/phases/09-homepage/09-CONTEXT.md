# Phase 9: Homepage - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Landing page that displays a curated random selection of photos from across all albums. Visitors can click photos to view in lightbox and navigate to album listing. Creating albums and managing photos are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Layout & photo display

- Hero + grid layout: One large featured photo at top, followed by smaller grid below
- Hero photo selection and sizing: Claude's discretion
- Grid quantity: 6-8 photos below the hero image
- Grid sizing: Claude's discretion (uniform cells vs aspect ratio preservation)

### Visual hierarchy

- Spacious and minimal density: Lots of whitespace, photos breathe
- No site title: Let the photos speak for themselves
- White background: Clean gallery feel, traditional portfolio look
- Completely clean photo styling: No borders, shadows, or hover effects — just the photos

### Navigation & interaction

- Clicking photo opens lightbox with full-screen view
- Lightbox navigation: Previous/next stays within the 7-9 homepage photos only
- Minimal header/nav bar for album discovery
- Header contains: 'Albums' link + logo/initials

### Claude's Discretion

- Hero photo selection logic and sizing
- Grid photo sizing strategy (uniform vs varied)
- Exact spacing and whitespace implementation
- Logo/initials design and placement in header
