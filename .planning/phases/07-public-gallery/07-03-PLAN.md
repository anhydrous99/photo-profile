  <what-built>
Complete public gallery with:
- Image serving API route (/api/images/[photoId]/[filename])
- Album listing page (/albums)
- Album detail page with responsive photo grid (/albums/[id])
- Breadcrumb navigation
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

2. Test album listing (http://localhost:3000/albums):
   - [ ] Published albums appear with cover thumbnails
   - [ ] Albums in correct order (admin's sortOrder)
   - [ ] Compact list layout (small thumbnails + title only)
   - [ ] Hover effect on album links

3. Test album detail (click any album):
   - [ ] Breadcrumb shows: Home > Albums > [Album Name]
   - [ ] Album title and description display
   - [ ] Photo grid shows photos

4. Test responsive layout (resize browser or use DevTools):
   - [ ] Mobile (~375px): 1 column of photos
   - [ ] Tablet (~768px): 2 columns of photos
   - [ ] Desktop (~1200px): 3 columns of photos
   - [ ] Generous spacing between photos

5. Test image loading (Network tab):
   - [ ] Images load from /api/images/... URLs
   - [ ] Response headers show Cache-Control: immutable
   - [ ] Second visit loads from cache (304 or disk cache)

6. Test error cases:
   - [ ] Non-existent album ID shows 404
   - [ ] Album with no photos shows empty message
