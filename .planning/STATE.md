## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Docker not installed on development machine — Redis service not tested (docker-compose.yml created and ready)
- coverPhotoId FK constraint is NO ACTION instead of SET NULL (schema.ts defines SET NULL but existing DB has NO ACTION). Non-blocking but should be fixed in future migration.
